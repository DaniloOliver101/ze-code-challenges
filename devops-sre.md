# DevOps / SRE Challenge

Based on [Coveo DevOps Challenge](https://github.com/coveo/devops-coding-challenge)

## About the Challenge... 

The challenge is to develop an AWS S3 storage analysis tool. To test your tool, you will have to create a free [Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/en/free/) account (if you don't already have one).

## Specifications

The tool is a shell command line utility that returns information over all [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) buckets in an Amazon account.

- Your tool must work on Linux, OSX and Windows.
- It must be easy to install and use.
- Ideally, your tool won't require installation of any other tools / libraries / frameworks to work.
- Time is money, we cannot afford running a tool that takes hours to complete, your solution should return results within seconds (or minutes if you are willing to test our patience :-).

### The tool must return the following information

For each bucket:
- Name
- Creation date
- Number of files
- Total size of files in KB
- Last modified date of the most recent file
- And the most important of all, **how much does it cost**
  
### The following options should be supported

- Filter buckets: support prefixes, glob and/or regexes in the bucket filter (e.g.: s3://mybucket/Folder/SubFolder/log*).
- Get additional buckets information (life cycle, cross-region replication, etc.) via explicit option

Some statistics to check the percentage of space used by a bucket, or any other good ideas you could have, are more than welcome.

## Rules

- Your are free to use the programming language and the [SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/) of your choice, but remember that installation must not require us to install external tools in order to test the result of your work.
- We will test your work in our environment (which contains **several millions of files**). The overall performance of your tool will be evaluated. Most of the projects we receive take weeks to run in our environment, can you do better?

## Advice

- **Try to design and implement your solution as you would do for real production code**. Show us how you create clean, maintainable code that does awesome stuff. Build something that we'd be happy to contribute to. This is not a programming contest where dirty hacks win the game.
- Feel free to add more features! Really, we're curious about what you can think of. We'd expect the same if you worked with us.
- Documentation and maintainability is a plus.
- Don't you forget those unit tests.
- We donâ€™t want to know if you can do exactly as asked (or everybody would have the same result). We want to know what **you** bring to the table when working on a project, what is your secret sauce. More features? Best solution? Thinking outside the box?


## How to deliver it

Your code must be made available on GitHub or any other public version control software. Your project must be a standalone project (i.e. **do not fork it from our challenge or any other project**). As soon as you make it available, reach your contact at ZX Ventures in order to proceed in the recruiting process.
